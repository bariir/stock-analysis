# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
In this stock analysis project, I am helping Steve to analyze a stock portfolio for his parents. This analysis includes entire stock market dataset from the last couple of years (2017 and 2018) stocks for multiple tickers.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Results
I've included the link to the images of 2017 and 2018 stock analysis performance of the refactored script.

The performance of the original script "Analysis for All Stocks" for 2017 took 0.7890625 seconds while Refactored script for 2017 stocks took 0.171875 seconds. This is more than 60 increase in performance. 

The performance of the original script "Analysis for All Stocks" for 2018 took 0.8671875 seconds while Refactored script for 2018 stocks took 0.1484375 seconds. This is more than 70 increase in performance.

## Summary

### In a summary statement, address the following questions
    1.	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
 In my view, the advantages of refactoring a code are things. First it makes a clean code and second, it optimizes the code. I really don't see any disadvantages based on refactoring code. The only thing I can think of is if the original code is not functionally working. In this case, there is no reason to refactor but fix the code first.
        
    2.	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The original VBA script is the initial code and there are always better ways to write a code. Itâ€™s expected to refactor your original code before you deploy it in a production environment.
